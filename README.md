# üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ Fam Finder

A fun marketplace app designed in 5 days at Le Wagon. The concept is to provide a platform for people to offer their services as family members (e.g. mother, brother etc.) or partners (e.g. girlfriend, boyfriend) or to find someone offering such services. Based on an Airbnb model, we wanted to develop a system where users could have a single profile that handled both use cases, which we implemented through 'roles'. A user can have many roles, set the price per hour, and see upcoming bookings (as service provider or renter).

## Development process

### Role: Front End Developer

This was our first full group experience using the git workflow. It was a largely collaborative effort that saw overlapping roles but as front end developer I was responsible for general UI design and guiding the user experience. This included designing the index and show page for roles, as well as user profiles and the implementation of the booking form system on a user's role page.
